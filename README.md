## AoC2018
I chose to write this year's solutions in Rust without some particular target but just for learning. 

To run a solution: 
```Bash
cd aoc2018
cargo run --bin d{day}
```
Note: This library has a dependency on Z3. You will either need to have the Z3 dependency already installed, or just install z3 by entering the following commands in the terminal(Ubuntu 18.04):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install z3
```
